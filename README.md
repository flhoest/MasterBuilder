# MasterBuilder
## Rubrik Master Builder Challenge

This challenge is initiated by Rubrik to stimulate creativity and encourage using their API stack to get info or control the Rubrik appliances. This has to be seen as a coding contest.

_There is a total of 5 challenges._

## Quick note for testers

All my projects relies on 3 files : 

* The Rubrik Framework that enables functions who are calling Rubrik APIs (rkFramework.php);
* The credential files that grant access to a specific Rubrik cluster with specific user name and password (rkCredentials.php);
* The project itself (whatever masterBuilder-x.php)

Ideally they must be in the same directory to maintain consistency.
